# NoCap

Did you know Superflight has a speedcap? 1250 max & 400 min. You can see this in the pictures below.

This mod moves the limit to 99999 max & -99999 min, making the speedcap basically unlimited (99999 isn't possible during normal play). **While this does make the player go backwards which could catch you off guard, unfortunately the min needs to be the opposite number as the max otherwise the player would have no movement.** The picture below shows the mod in action.
